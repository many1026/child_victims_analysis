# Public Health Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze public health data to identify trends, inefficiencies, and disparities in healthcare. Utilizing Python for data collection, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and in-depth statistical analysis, we seek to uncover insights that could inform public health policies and improve healthcare practices.

## Objective
The primary goal is to examine specific public health issues such as trends in chronic diseases, vaccination rates, and disparities in healthcare access, focusing on a defined geographical scope and time frame.

## Data Sources
Data for this project is sourced from reputable public health databases and platforms. We ensure the data encompasses variables relevant to our objectives, including demographic information, disease incidence rates, and healthcare facility locations.
